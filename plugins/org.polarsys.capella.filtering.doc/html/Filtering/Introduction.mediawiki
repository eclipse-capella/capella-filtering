=Introduction=

Filtering is an addon to filter capella models. It provides several capabilities:

* Definition of filtering criteria to be associated with model elements
* Definition of results containing criteria
* Visualization of criteria and results in diagrams
* Creation of filtered models

In this Add-On, Capella elements are enriched with filtering related information (see Appendix 1: Filtering Add-On Metamodel). The new functionalities for filtering management presented in the following sections are built on top of this filtering information.
